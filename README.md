# PipeForces
Program that determines whether a system of pipes will be able to withstand the forces exerted on it.

This program was written for my father. He is a mechanical engineer and had a project where he had to calculate 
if the systems of pipes designed would be able to withstand the forces exerted on them. The process takes long when
 done by hand, as it requires one to look up many values in tables and to approximate values if the the value one 
 is looking for is not in the table. One needs to look up values depending on the maximum and minimum temperature 
 the pipes will experience and the material the pipes are made of. These values are stored in a Microsoft Access database.
 In addition, it does conversions from imperial to metric and Fahrenheit to Celcius (the user will enter values in
 metric, but the formula requires values in imperial units).

The systems of pipes are made up of two or three pipes, arranged in a U, L, or Z shaped bend. The user needs to enter
the lengths of the pipes, minimum and maximum temperatures and the material the pipes are made of. The program performs
 some calculations and looks up values in the database. The user then has to look up a value on a graph (I could not
  automate this) to enter, and then the final calculations are performed, and the user is informed of whether the system is 
  safe or not.

I wrote this program some time in the first half of 2013. It was the first project I attmepted that was not for school.
